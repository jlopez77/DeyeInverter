# DeyeInverter
Small utility to read data from DEYE Inverters through the Solarman Datalogger. Works with S/N 17*

Tests indicate that the full ModBus is available through the TCP connection. **Probably** this *can lead* to modifying Inverter Configuration via TCP calls.

Thanks to @fjcarretero https://github.com/fjcarretero for his incredible support on understanding the data from and to the datalogger.
Thanks to @xtheone https://github.com/XtheOne for his original V4 reader that was an inspiration (and I borrowed *some* code).

# Configuration

Edit the config.cfg and enter the following data:
```
[DeyeInverter]
inverter_ip=192.168.X.XXX
inverter_port=8899
inverter_sn=17XXXXXXXX
installed_power=XXXXX #power in Watts e.g. for 4.5kW write 4500
mqtt=1  # set to 1 for MQTT output, 0 for JSON output.
mqtt_server=192.168.X.X
mqtt_port=1883
mqtt_topic=XXXXXXXXXXXX
mqtt_username=
mqtt_passwd=
```

# Run

# Known Issues

The inverter is not fast enough to answer, you can get timeouts if you query it too often.

# Contrib

Python is not my strongest suite, feel free to suggest, rewrite or add whatever you feel is necessary.

# Home Assistant support

The folder deye_logger contains a Homeassistant add-on. Reference the README.md file in that folder more information.
